<h3>usbm.ca  will help you get a better understanding of our biological relationship with the planet</h3>

<p>We live on a small planet. Small enough the the word as it is was created by the interaction of the energies of the plant. The factors are many.</p>

<p>They can be simplified into 4 basic groups</p>

<ul>
  <li><h2>Mental </h2></li>
  <li><h2>Spiritual</h2></li>
  <li><h2>Emotional</h2></li>
  <li><h2>Physical</h2></li>
</ul>

<p>All these things effect how we go to were we are today. They exist in each of the organisms that exist on the planet Including the planet it self. So refer to the Global organism as Gaia. From science we learn that it all can be broken down into colonies. The sum of the organisms and what they are made up create the whole organism. </p>

<p>These groups exist in one form or another in all organism. Living most likely, but maybe not just living colonies.</p>
 <p>The Honey Bee is a fantastic example to show these concepts. For more info see our sustainable beekeeping course. </p>
