<h1>Why are they considered unsafe by security experts.</h1>

<h2>There are 4 main reasons they are considered unsafe.</h2>

<ol><li>
J<h2>avaScript are accessible by anyone.</h2> <p>By simply right clicking the page and  Then clicking the view page source you will the the entire code that is used to create the page. Most of it will be HTML. Java is embedded in the page by The HTML Code primarily in the 
<header> </header> area of the file.

<script type="text/javascript" src="/ace/ace.js" defer="false" data-cfasync="false"></script>
 In the view page source you can click on the src= which is the link to the file. You will then see all of the code.
 
 This means anyone can read the code.
    </p>
</li>
<li><h2>JavaScript is executed by the browser</h2> This means the code runs on your system. This means that your computer runs all the scripts with local rights. So it can read your drive and transfer the contents to the writer of the script. Your cookie file, password file etc can be transferred to the script writer.</li> 
<li>JavaScript can also save files to your disk. This could be a virus. This if the prime reason that virus get on your computer!</li>
<li>Click tracking is another. Your privacy is invaded by Google every time a site owner enables Google analytic on their site. Yes it is all hyped up about traffic on your site. It in fact means little as most hosting services have builtin traffic analyzers. Google promotes this to sell. Placement is effected more by payments to Google than your actual usage. It is simply an invasion of you and your clients right to privacy.</li>

</ol>

<p>This is why it is important to have a script blocker. Most sites are safe but there are lots that are not. Your choice of browser here is one of your first lines of defence. Ordered by roughly safety</p>
<ol>
  <li><h3>FireFox</h3> with No-script And tracking blocking enabled.</li>
  <li><h3>Opera</h3> with a script blocker</li>
  <li><h3>Internet explorer</h3> This browser has until recently be the worst browser to use and write for.</li>
  <li><h3>Chrome</h3> This browser was developed from the ground up by Google to invade your privacy. Never use this browser.</li>
</ol>
