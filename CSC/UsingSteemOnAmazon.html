<h2>Using Steem Coin on Amazon</h2>

<h3><strong>Hi Fellow Steemians</strong>Thanks for joining us./h3>

<p>We are going to explore spending our earned STD. Found a site that will allow me to spend my Steem dollars on Amazon. Thanks @silasdavid for the resteem </p>

 <p>https://steemit.com/paywithsteem/@paywithsteem/paywithsteem-announcing-our-amazon-wish-list-feature Even comes with a tutorial on How to do it. </p>
<p>Vary complicated. You have to have an account on Discord. And fee is a bit at 15 to 20%. This of course would change as the process becomes simpler and more automated.</p>
<p>Cut from their tutorial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Go to Amazon and find the item that you would like to purchase.
<li>Step 2: Add the item you would like to purchase to a wishlist or create one if you have not already got one. We have provided pictures below these steps to show you how.</li>
<li>Step 3: Get your wishlist link (Make sure it is set to public and your home address is selected)</li></li> 
<li>Step 4: Send us your link on Discord - https://discord.gg/ux6Dm2G</li>
<li>Step 5: We will then give you a quote (15 - 20% more than Amazon prices)</li>
<li>Step 6: If you agree on the price send the total amount of SBD we tell you to and we will fulfill your order! </li> 
</ul
<p>Complicated. Most will choose to wait for a more direct system. Biggest draw back is having to join another site. The other is someone else making the purchase. </p>

<p>This is as far as I went this time around. Rose more questions rather than answered. </p>

<p>How ever it is fare simpler than going though the conversion to bit coin to ? for your purchace.</p>

<p>In time this process will be simpler and more direct. This can be used now to get your needs from Amazon. </p>
