this is nicly improved app from the old version sends and recives calls no proble.

Unless you spring for the pro version texting is not avaible in the Desktop version. Haven't checked to see if video call are affected.

both chat(texting) and video cals are available in the android version.
setup is the same it is setup on the phone you gave me.

I am working on a more fromal arangement with Zoiper for other options on the desktop version.

Texting is activated on your account. It is comfigured to send and email to you when a text is recived by the system.

You will only be able to send and recieve text from your smart phone at this time. Unless of course you upgrade zoiper.

I will continue to look for linux texting options.
