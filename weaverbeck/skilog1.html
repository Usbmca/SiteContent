<h2>First ski of the season!</h2>

<h3>Hi Fellow Steemians</h3>

<p>Ya it the best time of the year! ski season. This year is off to a bit of a late start. And it is far two warm yet. Bumping around 0c. Best winter temperatures are -5 to -15. Cold enough for the moisture to freeze out of the air. Making it easy for both me and the bees. NO dampness in the air.</p>

<p>We went up to our favorate area to ski. Unfortunalty the lose entrence has been sadly comprimized by carpet bagger loggers. Clear cutting the area below the main road for short term corporate profit.Select logging would net more timber per year than clear cutting. Dose not look good on this 1/4 share holder reports. But thatâ€™s a whole other issue. </p>

<p>The road we used in the past is now ploughed to make way for more destruction right in the snowshoe area. </p>

<p>We continued up the road to our higher access to the area. The road was plouged right in. I assume to what appears to be a small mining operation. We stopped at the lower edge of this area to give it a go.</p>

<sub>This shot is attualy at the end of the trip and shows a clear cut with new cutting in the next block in the back of the photo. Accessed by our old road in that was ploughed.</sub>

<p>The above photo is of an area we usual skied to from the lower road. In last years adventures we skied almost to the end of the road we started from today</p>

<p>I took videos of the trip but I have yet to figure how to get them out of the phone short of moving the sd card.  I will post them tomorrow.</p>

<p>By the way the new boots, from the previous ski post, were fantastic.</p>

<p>Thanks again for dropping by and sharing this adventure.</p>
